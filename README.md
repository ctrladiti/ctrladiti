## üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm a developer, problem solver, and lifelong learner who loves building things that make a difference ‚Äî whether it's through a line of clean code, a powerful data insight, or a seamless user interface.

I approach tech with a balance of logic and creativity. My journey started with writing algorithms in C++, and along the way, I discovered a love for Python, data, and designing user-centric solutions. What excites me most is understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind problems and turning that into a working, efficient product.

Currently, I‚Äôm focused on:

- Exploring real-world problems through data science and machine learning
- Designing interactive dashboards that tell compelling stories
- Deepening my expertise in SQL, preprocessing pipelines, and ML modeling
- Constantly pushing myself to solve tougher problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank

Beyond code, I enjoy the architecture of projects ‚Äî thinking through the flow, edge cases, and user experience. I'm someone who learns fast, works independently when needed, but thrives in collaborative environments where feedback and iteration are key.

I‚Äôm also someone who values clean code, clear logic, and the satisfaction that comes when things ‚Äújust work‚Äù.

I also recently built and deployed my personal [Portfolio Website](https://ctrladiti.github.io/index.html) as a front-end learning experiment‚Äîwithout only a little prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS when I started.
